As expected, the simulated death rate is consistent with $p_{\rm{d}}$. The initial number of infected individuals, 
here set to five, only affects the onset time and not the total number of deads. In the example above about 1 ‰ of the population is infected after ~230 days. Starting with e.g. 500 infected individuals we find that 1 ‰ of the population is infected after 80 days, but all other results are unchanged (data not shown). Such a shift in the onset is not important here.
